# Project: Escape Room Python Game

<br />

- Escape Room Game, created in Python as part of my Master's in Data Science & Machine Learning at Ironhack.
- This repo is an initial implementation of the core logic of the game. It also includes data validation tests (with `pytest`).
- The group version of this same project, created with Maria Aguilar and Patricia Gim√©nez is available here: https://github.com/mariaaguilarvega/scape_room_project
